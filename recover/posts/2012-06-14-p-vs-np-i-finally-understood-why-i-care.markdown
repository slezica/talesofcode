What changes if, after so many years, someone finally proves what everyone seems
to suspect: **P != NP**? Why is it important? What does the question tell me?
Some problems are harder than others? No shit. Really?

Well, what makes a problem **hard**? Is it hard for you? Hard for me? Hard for
the average human?

Those are entirely different criteria, for almost any interpretation of _you_,
_me_ and _average human_. **Or are they?** Well, it depends. Here's the key
question:

**Do problems have intrinsic difficulty, or is difficulty dependent on the
approach?**

In other words â€“ is **P != NP**?
