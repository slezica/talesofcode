I meet more and more people that seem to think intellect works somewhat like
this:

1.  Ignorance
2.  **_Eureka_**!
3.  Comprehension

Well, here's the deal. It's more like this:

1.  Ignore **it**
2.  Think **it** may be
3.  Be convinced **it** is
4.  Question **it**
5.  Realize **it** is not.
6.  Repeat

Now, the meaning of this _relevation_ is twofold:

1.  If you don't understand something, it's not because you _just simply can't_,
or because _it's hard stuff_â€“ it's because **you are being lazy**. There is no
trick to it, no magic. Rinse and repeat. Great thinkers are quick, trained
repeaters.

2.  You can never understand **it** fully. Embrace that. It also means you can
**always** understand **it** better.

So I don't want to hear any more of this _I can't get it_ or _this is out of my
reach_ nonsense. It is out of my reach too, I'm just working hard to get closer.
