Did you ever have to face the somewhat embarrassing task of merging x-y
coordinates with row-col coordinates code? Did you hate humanity and yourself?

I did. Twice.

It was nobody's fault, really. It's actually `Point`'s fault. For the
mathematically inclined, `Point(x, y)` means
_x-horizontal-y-vertical-from-lower-left_, while in the world of matrices,
that's _x-vertical-y-horizontal-from-top-left_.

I take a vow, here and now, and the Internet can bare witness: I will **_never,
ever_** use the name `Point` again, and favor `rc` and `xy` instead. No
confusion possible.
