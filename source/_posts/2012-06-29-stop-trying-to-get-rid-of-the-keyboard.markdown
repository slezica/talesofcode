We used to communicate in _gestures_.

Gestures were good to refer to _concrete_ stuff, but as communication became
more abstract, gestures turned out to be a poor transport.

So we created _language_.

With language we could express ideas of incredible complexity, such as this very
sentence you are reading. I dare you to say that in signs.

Language was such a good idea, that things worth _saying_ became things worth
_writing_, and eventually _portable, personal_ means for writing were invented.
Then writing was easy, but it had to be faster: the typewriter partially
addressed that need, and finally the _keyboard_ came along.

The _fastest_ way of using the _best_ tool for communication we ever created.
The _keyboard_.

Smartphones, tablets, they are all fantastic devices, but we still use
notebooks. Why? Simple: they have a _keyboard_. They enable us to express
complex ideas quickly, using _language_.

I hope this gesture madness is just a passing trend.
